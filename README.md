# `Mask-Detection`
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that automatically checks whether 
people are wearing masks. The application is planned to be used to control whether there is a 
mask on the supervised faces by creating a deep learning model. 2000 masked and 2000 
unmasked data from Github were used to train the model. Many frameworks such as tensorflow, 
keras, numpy, opencv have been used.
